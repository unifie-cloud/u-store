## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

- [Unifie.cloud](https://www.unifie.cloud/doc/docs/Overview/)
  streamlines application deployment to your own cloud account, empowering you with the flexibility and scalability you need to thrive.

  This project use unifie.cloud API to mange deployments in kubernetes clusters.

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
  This is a React framework that provides features such as server-side rendering and static site generation. It's used for building the user interface of your application. The main configuration for Next.js can be found in next.config.js.
- [GraphQL Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server)
  Is a query language and server-side runtime for application programming interfaces (APIs) that gives API clients exactly the data they requested.
- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)
  Ant Design is a comprehensive design system that includes a complete set of React components. Since React is component-based, it's pretty easy to use Ant Design's React components as building blocks to quickly put together a prototype
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
  This is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It's used for styling the application. The configuration for Tailwind CSS can be found in postcss.config.js.
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org)
  This is a powerful, open source object-relational database system. It's used for storing application data. The connection to Postgres is likely managed through Prisma.
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
  This is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's used for creating the interactive elements of your application. The React components are located in the components directory.
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io)
  This is an open-source database toolkit. It's used for object-relational mapping, which simplifies the process of writing database queries. Prisma configuration and schema can be found in the prisma directory.

## ‚ú® Local development

Please follow these simple steps to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (Version: >=21.x)
- PostgreSQL
- NPM
- Docker compose

### Development

#### 1. Setup

- [Fork](https://github.com/unifie-cloud/u-store/fork) the repository
- Clone the repository by using this command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/u-store.git
```

#### 2. Go to the project folder

```bash
cd u-store/packages/store
```

#### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### 4. Set up your .env file

Duplicate `.env.example` to `.env`.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

#### 5. Create a database (Optional)

To make the process of installing dependencies easier, we offer a `docker-compose.yml` with a Postgres container.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### 6. Set up database schema

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

#### 7. Start the server

In a development environment:

```bash
npm run dev
```

#### 8. Start the Prisma Studio

Prisma Studio is a visual editor for the data in your database.

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

#### 9. Testing

We are using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to execute E2E tests. Add all tests inside the `/tests` folder.

Update `playwright.config.ts` to change the playwright configuration.

##### Install Playwright dependencies

```bash
npm run playwright:update
```

##### Run E2E tests

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

_Note: HTML test report is generated inside the `report` folder. Currently supported browsers for test execution `chromium` and `firefox`_
